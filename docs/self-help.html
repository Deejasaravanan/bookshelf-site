        <h3>Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones</h3>
        <p class="author">by James Clear</p>
        <p>If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat
            themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
            You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system
            that can take you to new heights.
        </p>
        <p>Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you
            need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to
            redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any
            other goal.</p>

        <h3>The Secret</h3>
        <p class="author">by Rhonda Byrne</p>
        <p>Fragments of a Great Secret have been found in the oral traditions, in literature, in religions, and philosophies
            throughout the centuries. For the first time, all the pieces of The Secret come together in an incredible revelation
            that will be life-transforming for all who experience it.</p>
        <p>In this book, you’ll learn how to use The Secret in every aspect of your life—money, health, relationships,
            happiness, and in every interaction you have in the world. You’ll begin to understand the hidden, untapped power
            that’s within you, and this revelation can bring joy to every aspect of your life.</p>
        <p>The Secret contains wisdom from modern-day teachers—men and women who have used it to achieve health, wealth, and
            happiness. By applying the knowledge of The Secret, they bring to light compelling stories of eradicating disease,
            acquiring massive wealth, overcoming obstacles, and achieving what many would regard as impossible.</p>
