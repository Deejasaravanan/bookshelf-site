        <h3>The Secret</h3>
        <p class="author">by Rhonda Byrne</p>
        <p>Fragments of a Great Secret have been found in the oral traditions, in literature, in religions, and
            philosophies
            throughout the centuries. For the first time, all the pieces of The Secret come together in an incredible
            revelation
            that will be life-transforming for all who experience it.</p>
        <p>In this book, you’ll learn how to use The Secret in every aspect of your life—money, health, relationships,
            happiness, and in every interaction you have in the world. You’ll begin to understand the hidden, untapped
            power
            that’s within you, and this revelation can bring joy to every aspect of your life.</p>
        <p>The Secret contains wisdom from modern-day teachers—men and women who have used it to achieve health, wealth,
            and
            happiness. By applying the knowledge of The Secret, they bring to light compelling stories of eradicating
            disease,
            acquiring massive wealth, overcoming obstacles, and achieving what many would regard as impossible.</p>

        <h3>Sea of Tranquility</h3>
        <p class="author">by Emily St. John Mandel</p>
        <p>Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from polite society
            following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the
            Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal--an experience
            that shocks him to his core.</p>
        <p>Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth,
            but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within
            the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in
            the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him.</p>
        <p>When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly
            in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to
            madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night
            City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the
            timeline of the universe.</p>
        <p>A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a
            novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.</p>

        <h3>The Alchemist</h3>
        <p class="author">by Panlo Coelho</p>
        <p>Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, The Alchemist has
            become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming the lives of countless
            readers across generations.</p>
        <p>Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to
            travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more
            satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to
            our hearts, recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most
            importantly, following our dreams.</p>
